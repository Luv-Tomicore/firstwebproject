        &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>TOP 5 ICONIC FASHION TRENDS &nbsp; (SOOOO FETCH)</b>
      </h1>
      <!-- Introductory text for fashion trends -->
      <p>
        &nbsp;These are the top five iconic fashion trends in my opinion. They
        are very iconic and still remain relevant till today.<br />While some of
        these have been alive for a while, some of them are just getting
        started. Fashion trends are a way of styling or dressing fashionable or
        popular items.<br />
        Often more popular during a timeframe, they are usually a combination of
        key items and colors to create a style of dressing.<br /><br />

      <!-- Description for Y2K fashion -->
      <p>
        Y2K is one of the best fashion trends ever created in my opinion.<br />
        That is very evident till today as people still find ways to style
        themselves like this. Y2K is a look that spans from the late 90's to
        early 2000s, but is still popular till today.<br />
        It was typically a combination of low-rise jeans, scarf tops, boot cut
        jeans, velour tracksuits, pedal pushers (capris), pastels, and
        metallics.<br />
        The accessories were typically: bucket hats, trucker caps, bowling bags,
        mini bags, low waist belts, sandals, and butterfly clips.

      <p>
        &nbsp; 90's fashion still plays a major role in fashion today. It is
        still constantly referenced and is one of the building blocks of
        fashion in pop culture.<br />
        It brought on the look of baggy clothing, denim on denim, and streetwear
        looks.

      <!-- Description for glamour fashion -->
      <p>
        This style is not very common among people's everyday lives.<br />
        It is mostly from brands like Chanel, Dior, Versace...<br />
        However, even though it is mostly for runways or celebrity award shows,
        some people still like to see the streets as their runway or their
        office.<br />
        They still wear runway-worthy clothes as everyday wear.<br />
        I personally think this is a style that needs more recognition, and it is
        really fun.<br />
        It consists of designer pieces or formal wear like suits, dresses,
        and futuristic clothing that are often a combination of different styles.<br />
        It is accessorized with sunglasses, designer bags, designer heels, glamour
        makeup, scarves, and designer jewelry. This style is mostly for formal
        occasions as it is not always the comfiest.
